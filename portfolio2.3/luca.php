            <p>Luca Madu, who are they? The band
                started in 2016 by Lotte Slangen.
                Currently they have published a few songs
                and are constantly working on
                creating more.
                A band which is still young, but full of
                ideas and passion.
                The band consists of several, some
                traditional but other quite unique instruments,
                such as a cello and a violin.
                By using these unique instruments,
                Luca Madu creates a sound which is
                not commonly heard in this genre.</p>

            <p>Me and my group had to make a whole branding around Luca Madu. We had to make a bunch of stuff.
               First we had to visualize the ambience the band created while performing. We did this with <b>moodboards</b>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="moodboards">
            <img class="moods" src="images/mood1.png" alt="">
            <img class="moods" src="images/mood2.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="luca2-p">
            <p> After this we had to come up with a strategy for the band. What is their mission, vision and who is their target
                audience. Also we had to determine how future media products should like like. From t-shirts to keycords and many more.
                All this was combined into a <b>Brand guide</b>.
