            <p>Bright code has designed a programming workshop for the children in sixth grade. Our group had to work with autistic children. Bright code showed the children that
                programming doesn't have to be boring but can be a lot of fun. Before we started with the digital programming, we decided to
                begin with logical programming on paper.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The first assignment we designed for these children was to draw a <b>pixel monster</b>. They had to stick by a few rules they had to follow.
                When they follow the rules, they could draw the monster. We had 4 different levels where the difficulty got harder and harder. At the end
                they could write their own rules and let their friends draw the monster.

            <p>After the first assignment we started with <b>recognising shapes</b> in images. Before they could program their own monster,
               it is important that they can recognise shapes. The monster they're going to draw in the last assignment is made out of shapes.
               So it is important that they can recognise it.

            <p>With this assignment we prepared the children for the digital programming language, P5. We used the <b>X and Y grid</b> They learn how to make some
                basic shapes, where they eventually can make a whole figure. They also got to work with coordinates.

            <p>The last assignment the children started to draw their monster. Before I gave them a more elaborate <b>introduction to programming</b> 
                with P5.

            <p>Bright code was a real fun experience with the children. The teachers and the children were very excited about it all.
                This was not like geography or a English class. A whole day they got to spend with us programming. Want to try draw a monster yourself?
